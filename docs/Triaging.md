Respective tech leads are responsible for triaging every issue and PR opened in the internal repository within a reasonable turnaround time.

> Note: For documentation changes, please initiate discussions using [ï»¿this template](https://github.com/company/internal-repo/discussions/new?category=ideas).

When an issue is opened, it will be labeled as one of the following:

- `**bug**` : Unconfirmed issue with the internal project.
- `**feature**` : A proposal or request for a new functionality or enhancement in the project.
- `**question**` : A request for further information or clarification about the project.
### Issue Triaging Flow

When a tech lead receives an issue, they should first determine its type. Once the type is identified, they can then proceed with the following steps:

1. **Bug**:
    - **Has Repro?**: This is to check if the bug issue comes with reproducible steps. This is vital to verify and fix the bug.
        - **Yes**: If the bug is reproducible, then label it as `**Issue ready to claim**` . This means developers can now take this issue and start working on a fix.
        - **No**: If the bug does not have reproducible steps, label it as `**Ask for repro**` . The tech lead or a team member should ask the issue reporter for more detailed steps or examples that can lead to reproduction of the bug.
2. **Feature**:
    - **Well Specced?**: Before moving forward with a feature request, it's crucial to ensure the proposal is well-defined, clear, and feasible.
        - **Yes**: If the feature is well-documented and defined, then label it as `**Issue ready to claim**` . This means developers can now take this issue and start working on implementing the feature.
        - **No**: If the feature is not well-specced, then it may need further discussion or clarification. The tech lead or a team member should reach out to the person proposing the feature for more details or explanations.
3. **Question**:
    - If an issue is labeled as a `**question**` , the tech lead or a relevant expert from the team should provide the necessary clarifications or answers. Once resolved, the issue can be closed.
